"""Contract tests for feature ordering in config and options flows.

Task: T007A - Phase 1: Contract Tests (Foundation)
Issue: #440

These tests validate the correct step ordering in configuration flows:
- Features selection comes after core settings
- Openings configuration comes before presets
- Presets is always the final configuration step
- Complete step sequence validation per system type

Feature Ordering Rules (Critical Dependencies):

Phase 1: System Configuration
1. System Type Selection
   └─> system_type: {simple_heater, ac_only, heater_cooler, heat_pump}

Phase 2: Core Settings
2. Core Settings (system-type-specific entities and tolerances)
   └─> heater/cooler/sensor entities, tolerances, min_cycle_duration

Phase 3: Feature Selection & Configuration
3. Features Selection (unified step)
   └─> configure_floor_heating, configure_fan, configure_humidity, configure_openings, configure_presets

4. Per-Feature Configuration (conditional, based on toggles)
   4a. Floor Heating Config (if enabled and system supports it)
   4b. Fan Config (if enabled and system supports it)
   4c. Humidity Config (if enabled and system supports it)

Phase 4: Dependent Features (Must Be Last)
5. Openings Configuration (depends on system type + core entities)
6. Presets Configuration (depends on ALL previous configuration)

Critical Ordering Constraints:
- ❌ INVALID: Presets before Openings (presets reference openings)
- ❌ INVALID: Openings before system entities configured (scope depends on HVAC modes)
- ❌ INVALID: Any feature configuration before features selection step
- ✅ VALID: Features → Floor → Fan → Humidity → Openings → Presets
