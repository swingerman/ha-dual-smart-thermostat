"""Contract tests for feature schema structure and keys.

Task: T007A - Phase 1: Contract Tests (Foundation)
Issue: #440

These tests validate that feature schemas produce expected keys and types:
- Floor heating schema keys and structure
- Fan schema keys and structure
- Humidity schema keys and structure
- Openings schema keys and structure
- Presets schema keys and structure

Each feature schema must provide the correct fields with proper types,
defaults, and selectors to match the data-model.md specification.
