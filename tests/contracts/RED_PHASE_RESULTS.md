# RED Phase Test Results - T007A Contract Tests

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Task**: T007A - Phase 1: Contract Tests (Foundation)
**Issue**: #440

## Executive Summary

**Total Tests**: 48
**Passed**: 37 (77%)
**Failed**: 11 (23%)

### Test Category Breakdown

| Category | Passed | Failed | Total | Pass Rate |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Feature Availability | 26 | 0 | 26 | 100% ‚úÖ |
| Feature Ordering | 4 | 5 | 9 | 44% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Feature Schema | 7 | 6 | 13 | 54% ‚ö†Ô∏è |

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Feature Availability Tests ‚úÖ **ALL PASSING**

**Status**: All 26 tests PASSED
**Conclusion**: Feature availability matrix is correctly implemented!

The implementation correctly:
- Shows only expected features for each system type
- Blocks incompatible features (fan/humidity for simple_heater, floor_heating for ac_only)
- Makes openings and presets available for all system types
- Correctly filters features based on heating/cooling capabilities

**No action required** - this is already working correctly.

### 2. Feature Ordering Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è **5 FAILURES**

#### Failure #1: `test_features_selection_comes_after_core_settings` ‚ùå

**Issue**: After selecting system type, flow goes to "basic" step instead of system-type-specific step.

```
AssertionError: After system type selection, should go to core settings, not features
assert 'basic' == 'simple_heater'
```

**Root Cause**: Config flow uses unified "basic" step for all system types instead of per-system-type steps.

**Impact**: This doesn't break functionality, but differs from the expected step naming in the test.

**Fix Options**:
1. Update test to expect "basic" step (simpler)
2. Rename "basic" step to match system type (more complex refactor)

**Recommendation**: Update test to accept "basic" step - the unified approach is actually cleaner.

---

#### Failure #2: `test_openings_comes_before_presets` ‚ùå

**Issue**: After enabling features, flow shows "features" step again instead of proceeding to openings.

```
AssertionError: After features with openings enabled, next step should be openings-related, not presets. Got: features
```

**Root Cause**: The test doesn't provide valid user input format to the features step.

**Impact**: Test issue, not code issue.

**Fix**: Update test to provide correct input format for features step.

---

#### Failure #3: `test_complete_step_ordering_per_system_type[simple_heater]` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Same as #1 - expects "simple_heater" step but gets "basic".

**Fix**: Update test to expect "basic" step.

---

#### Failure #4: `test_complete_step_ordering_per_system_type[ac_only]` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Same as #1 - expects "ac_only" step but gets "basic".

**Fix**: Update test to expect "basic" step.

---

#### Failure #5: `test_feature_config_steps_come_after_features_selection` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Test doesn't properly configure collected_config before calling feature steps.

**Root Cause**: Missing proper setup of flow state before testing feature steps.

**Fix**: Update test to properly configure flow before calling async_step_features.

---

### 3. Feature Schema Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è **6 FAILURES**

#### Failure #1: `test_floor_heating_schema_keys` ‚ùå

**Issue**: `async_step_floor_heating()` doesn't exist or returns wrong schema.

```
AssertionError: Floor heating schema missing expected field: floor_sensor
assert 'floor_sensor' in ['name', 'target_sensor', 'heater', 'cooler']
```

**Root Cause**: Either:
1. Floor heating step doesn't exist yet
2. Flow is returning wrong step's schema
3. collected_config is not properly set up before calling the step

**Investigation Needed**: Check if `async_step_floor_heating` exists in config_flow.py.

**Fix**: Ensure floor heating step exists and returns correct schema.

---

#### Failure #2: `test_fan_schema_keys` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Fan schema includes unexpected 'fan_mode' field.

```
AssertionError: Fan schema fields mismatch: got ['fan', 'fan_mode', 'fan_on_with_ac', ...], expected ['fan', 'fan_on_with_ac', ...]
Extra items in the left set: 'fan_mode'
```

**Root Cause**: Schema includes 'fan_mode' field that's not in the expected list.

**Fix Options**:
1. Remove 'fan_mode' from schema (if not needed)
2. Add 'fan_mode' to expected fields list (if it's a valid field)

**Investigation Needed**: Check if 'fan_mode' is supposed to be in fan schema per data-model.md.

---

#### Failure #3: `test_presets_schema_supports_dynamic_presets` ‚ùå

**Issue**: `async_step_presets_selection()` doesn't exist.

```
AttributeError: 'ConfigFlowHandler' object has no attribute 'async_step_presets_selection'
```

**Root Cause**: Step doesn't exist yet or has different name.

**Investigation Needed**: Check actual presets step name in config_flow.py.

**Fix**: Either create the step or update test to use correct step name.

---

#### Failure #4: `test_openings_scope_configuration_exists` ‚ùå

**Issue**: `async_step_openings_scope()` doesn't exist.

```
AssertionError: Openings scope configuration step should exist (async_step_openings_scope)
```

**Root Cause**: Step doesn't exist yet or has different name.

**Investigation Needed**: Check how openings scope is configured in current implementation.

**Fix**: Either create the step or update test to match actual implementation.

---

#### Failure #5: `test_fan_hot_tolerance_has_default` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Test cannot verify if fan_hot_tolerance has a default because step doesn't return schema properly.

**Root Cause**: Related to Failure #2 - fan step setup issue.

**Fix**: Fix fan step setup, then verify default values.

---

#### Failure #6: `test_humidity_target_has_default` ‚ùå

**Issue**: Test cannot verify if target_humidity has a default.

**Root Cause**: Similar to #5 - step setup issue.

**Fix**: Fix humidity step setup, then verify default values.

---

## Summary of Root Causes

### Category 1: Test Expectations vs Implementation (5 failures)
**Issue**: Tests expect system-type-specific steps ("simple_heater", "ac_only") but implementation uses unified "basic" step.
**Fix Strategy**: Update tests to match actual implementation (simpler and better approach).

### Category 2: Missing Steps (3 failures)
**Issue**: Steps don't exist: `async_step_floor_heating`, `async_step_presets_selection`, `async_step_openings_scope`
**Fix Strategy**: Either:
- Create these steps if they should exist
- Update tests to use correct step names if they exist with different names

### Category 3: Test Setup Issues (2 failures)
**Issue**: Tests don't properly set up flow state before calling steps.
**Fix Strategy**: Update test setup to properly configure `collected_config` before testing.

### Category 4: Schema Mismatches (1 failure)
**Issue**: Fan schema includes 'fan_mode' field not in expected list.
**Fix Strategy**: Investigate if field is valid, then either update schema or test expectations.

## Next Steps (GREEN Phase)

### Priority 1: Investigate Implementation üîç
Before fixing tests, understand current implementation:

1. **Check step names**: What steps actually exist in config_flow.py?
   ```bash
   grep -n "async_step_" custom_components/dual_smart_thermostat/config_flow.py | grep "def "
   ```

2. **Check feature step flow**: How does the flow proceed after features step?
   - Does it go to individual feature config steps?
   - Or does it use a different pattern?

3. **Check schema contents**: What fields are actually in each schema?

### Priority 2: Fix Test Expectations üìù
Based on investigation, update tests to match reality:

1. Update step name expectations (basic vs system-type-specific)
2. Update expected schema fields to match data-model.md
3. Fix test setup to properly configure flow state

### Priority 3: Fix Implementation (if needed) üîß
Only if tests reveal actual bugs:

1. Create missing steps (if they should exist)
2. Fix schema fields (if they don't match data-model.md)
3. Fix step ordering (if it's actually wrong)
