# Specification Quality Checklist: Separate Temperature Tolerances

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids implementation specifics while providing clear functional requirements. User stories focus on value delivery. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and comprehensive.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All clarification questions have been resolved and documented in the Design Decisions section. All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can configure heat_tolerance=0.3 and cool_tolerance=2.0, and the system maintains temperature within ±0.3°C in heating mode").

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: All 25 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-025) have clear, verifiable criteria. Four user stories with priorities (P1, P2, P3) cover the complete feature scope. Success criteria provide measurable targets for validation.

## Design Decisions (All Resolved)

### Decision 1: HEAT_COOL Mode Behavior
**Resolution**: Option B - Only support falling back to heat_tolerance/cool_tolerance based on active operation
**Impact**: No heat_cool_tolerance parameter; simpler implementation with per-operation control

### Decision 2: UI Placement
**Resolution**: Option A - Added to existing advanced settings step in options flow
**Impact**: Tolerance settings integrated into Advanced Settings; no additional navigation step

### Decision 3: New Installation Defaults
**Resolution**: Option B - Default both cold_tolerance and hot_tolerance to 0.3°C automatically
**Impact**: Simplified setup; defaults applied in config flows; users can customize

## Validation Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and all design decisions have been resolved. All checklist items pass validation.

**Summary**:
- ✅ 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 25 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-025)
- ✅ 10 measurable success criteria
- ✅ All clarifications resolved
- ✅ Comprehensive edge cases and testing strategy
- ✅ No implementation details in specification

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement needed
