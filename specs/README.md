# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for features being developed for the Dual Smart Thermostat integration.

## Purpose

Specifications in this directory serve as:
- **Design documents** before implementation
- **Reference documentation** during development
- **Historical records** of feature decisions

## Structure

Each feature spec should include:
1. **Overview** - What problem does this solve?
2. **Requirements** - What must the feature do?
3. **Design Decisions** - Key choices made during planning
4. **Technical Design** - How will it be implemented?
5. **Testing Strategy** - How will it be verified?
6. **Documentation Plan** - How will users learn about it?

## Current Specifications

- [issue-096-template-based-presets.md](issue-096-template-based-presets.md) - Template-based preset temperatures with reactive evaluation

## Workflow

1. **Create spec** - Document feature design before implementation
2. **Review & clarify** - Resolve uncertainties and decisions
3. **Implement** - Follow the spec during development
4. **Update** - Keep spec current if design changes during implementation
5. **Archive** - Mark as implemented once feature is complete

## Status Indicators

- 🟡 **Planning** - Specification in progress
- 🟢 **Ready** - Specification complete, ready to implement
- 🔵 **In Progress** - Implementation underway
- ✅ **Implemented** - Feature complete and merged
