# Specification Quality Checklist: Template-Based Preset Temperatures

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Validation Date**: 2025-12-01

**Summary**:
- Specification is complete with all mandatory sections
- No implementation details present (business-focused)
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear acceptance scenarios for all user stories
- Well-defined assumptions documented
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed - all aspects have reasonable defaults

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Spec successfully validated on first iteration
- No clarifications needed - all ambiguous areas addressed with reasonable assumptions
- Branch and spec folder correctly numbered as `004-template-based-presets` (highest existing spec was 003)
