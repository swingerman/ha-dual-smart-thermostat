# Cooler Only (AC) Configuration
#
# Air conditioning only - no heating capability.
# Perfect for: Window AC units, portable AC, cooling-only systems
#
# Documentation: https://github.com/swingerman/ha-dual-smart-thermostat#cooler-only-mode

climate:
  - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
    name: "Bedroom AC"

    # Required: Switch entity that controls your AC
    # This is called "heater" in config but represents your cooler when ac_mode=true
    heater: switch.bedroom_ac

    # Required: Set to true to indicate this is a cooling device
    ac_mode: true

    # Required: Temperature sensor for the room
    target_sensor: sensor.bedroom_temperature

    # Recommended: Start in cool mode
    initial_hvac_mode: "cool"

    # Optional: Tolerance - prevents frequent on/off cycling
    # AC turns ON when temp >= (target + hot_tolerance)
    # AC turns OFF when temp <= target
    hot_tolerance: 0.5

    # Optional: Minimum cycle duration - protects equipment
    # Prevents turning on/off more frequently than this
    min_cycle_duration:
      minutes: 5

# Example 2: AC with separate fan control
# Some AC units have independent fan switches that must be turned on with AC
# (Common in central AC systems with separate Y and G wires)
#
# climate:
#   - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
#     name: "Central AC"
#     heater: switch.ac_compressor          # "Y" wire / compressor
#     ac_mode: true
#     fan: switch.ac_fan                    # "G" wire / air handler
#     fan_on_with_ac: true                  # Turn on fan when AC runs
#     target_sensor: sensor.house_temperature
#     initial_hvac_mode: "cool"

# Example 3: AC with smart fan usage
# Fan runs when slightly warm, AC only when hot_tolerance exceeded
#
# climate:
#   - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
#     name: "Smart AC with Fan"
#     heater: switch.ac_compressor
#     ac_mode: true
#     fan: switch.standalone_fan
#     fan_hot_tolerance: 1.0                # Fan activates at target + 1°
#     hot_tolerance: 2.0                    # AC activates at target + 2°
#     target_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
#     initial_hvac_mode: "cool"

# Example 4: AC with outside air fan (free cooling)
# Only run fan if outside temp is cooler than inside
#
# climate:
#   - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
#     name: "AC with Outside Air"
#     heater: switch.ac_compressor
#     ac_mode: true
#     fan: switch.fan
#     fan_hot_tolerance: 1.0
#     outside_sensor: sensor.outside_temperature
#     fan_air_outside: true                 # Only run fan if outside is cooler
#     target_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
#     initial_hvac_mode: "cool"
