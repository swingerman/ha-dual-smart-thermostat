# Heater Only Configuration
#
# This is the simplest configuration - only heating, no cooling.
# Perfect for: Baseboard heaters, radiators, space heaters, boilers
#
# Documentation: https://github.com/swingerman/ha-dual-smart-thermostat#heater-only-mode

climate:
  - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
    name: "Living Room Heater"

    # Required: Switch entity that controls your heater
    heater: switch.living_room_heater

    # Required: Temperature sensor for the room
    target_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature

    # Recommended: Start in heat mode
    initial_hvac_mode: "heat"

    # Optional: Tolerance - prevents frequent on/off cycling
    # Heater turns ON when temp <= (target - cold_tolerance)
    # Heater turns OFF when temp >= target
    cold_tolerance: 0.5

    # Optional: Minimum cycle duration - protects equipment
    # Prevents turning on/off more frequently than this
    min_cycle_duration:
      minutes: 5

    # Optional: Keep alive interval for thermostatic valves
    # Some valves need periodic signals to prevent sticking
    # keep_alive:
    #   minutes: 15

# Example 2: Two-stage heating (with aux/emergency heat)
# Uncomment and customize if you have secondary/backup heating
#
# climate:
#   - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
#     name: "Living Room Heater with Aux"
#     heater: switch.primary_heater
#     secondary_heater: switch.aux_heater        # Auxiliary/emergency heater
#     secondary_heater_timeout: 01:00:00         # Activate aux after 1 hour
#     target_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
#     initial_hvac_mode: "heat"

# Example 3: Floor heating with temperature limits
# Uncomment and customize if you have floor heating
#
# climate:
#   - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
#     name: "Bathroom Floor Heat"
#     heater: switch.floor_heater
#     target_sensor: sensor.bathroom_temperature
#     floor_sensor: sensor.floor_temperature     # Floor temp sensor
#     max_floor_temp: 28                         # Max floor temp (°C)
#     min_floor_temp: 20                         # Min floor temp (°C)
#     initial_hvac_mode: "heat"
