# Heater + Cooler (Dual Mode) Configuration
#
# For systems with SEPARATE heating and cooling switches.
# This gives you true dual-mode capability with heat/cool mode.
#
# Perfect for: Central HVAC with separate heat/cool, systems with furnace + AC

climate:
  - platform: dual_smart_thermostat
    name: "House Thermostat"

    # Required: Separate switches for heating and cooling
    heater: switch.furnace
    cooler: switch.air_conditioner

    # Required: Temperature sensor
    target_sensor: sensor.house_temperature

    # Optional but recommended: Enable heat_cool mode
    # This allows maintaining a temperature range (like Nest's "Keep Between")
    heat_cool_mode: true

    # Optional: Separate tolerances for heating and cooling
    cold_tolerance: 0.5  # Heating tolerance
    hot_tolerance: 0.5   # Cooling tolerance

    # Optional: Minimum cycle durations
    min_cycle_duration:
      minutes: 5

# ========================================
# Example 2: Without heat_cool mode (Simple)
# Can only be in heat OR cool mode at a time

# Example 3: With Fan Support
# Central HVAC systems often have separate fan control

# ========================================
# Understanding heat_cool_mode
# ========================================
#
# With heat_cool_mode: true
# - You can set target_temp_low and target_temp_high
# - System automatically switches between heating and cooling
# - Maintains temperature within the range
# - Like Nest's "Keep Between" feature
#
# Available HVAC modes:
#   - heat_cool: Maintain temperature range (auto mode)
#   - heat: Heating only
#   - cool: Cooling only
#   - off: System off
#
# Example behavior with range 68-72°F:
#   - Temp drops to 67.5°F → Heating turns on
#   - Temp rises to 68.5°F → Heating turns off
#   - Temp rises to 72.5°F → Cooling turns on
#   - Temp drops to 71.5°F → Cooling turns off
#   - Temp between 68.5-71.5°F → Both off (within range)
