## 📋 Actions Taken

1. **Restored specs folder** from `001-develop-config-and` branch using `git checkout`
2. **Analyzed specifications** in `specs/001-develop-config-and/plan.md` and `tasks.md`
3. **Cross-referenced GitHub issues** with specification tasks
4. **Updated tasks.md** to mark completed tasks (T001, T002)
5. **Verified issue links** for all tasks T001-T012

## 🎯 Current Recommendation

**Immediate Priority**: Focus on **T003** (E2E CI setup) since the E2E foundation (T001-T002) is complete. This will enable continuous integration for the Config Flow work.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Complete T003 to get CI working
2. Tackle T004 to remove Advanced setup option
3. Proceed with system type implementations (T005-T006)
