# Python requirements for development.
#
# NOTE: Some runtime dependencies (packet capture, ffmpeg, turbojpeg) are provided
# as system packages and cannot be installed via pip. Install these on Debian/Ubuntu
# before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`:
#
# 	sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev python3-pcapy ffmpeg libjpeg-turbo-progs
#
# On some systems you may prefer `python3-pcapy` from apt (prebuilt), otherwise
# pip packages below will attempt to build C extensions against libpcap headers.
# Depending on your Python version (e.g. 3.13) some bindings may not build until
# upstream projects release compatible wheels.

# Optional Python-level pcap bindings. These may require libpcap headers (libpcap-dev)
# Optional Python-level pcap bindings. These are development-only and may require
# libpcap headers (`libpcap-dev`) and build tools. Move them to `requirements-dev.txt`
# so CI jobs that don't have system deps installed won't attempt to build them.
