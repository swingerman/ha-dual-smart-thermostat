"""Python requirements for development.

NOTE: Some runtime dependencies (packet capture, ffmpeg, turbojpeg) are provided
as system packages and cannot be installed via pip. Install these on Debian/Ubuntu
before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

	sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev python3-pcapy ffmpeg libjpeg-turbo-progs

On some systems you may prefer `python3-pcapy` from apt (prebuilt), otherwise
pip packages below will attempt to build C extensions against libpcap headers.
Depending on your Python version (e.g. 3.13) some bindings may not build until
upstream projects release compatible wheels.

# Optional Python-level pcap bindings. These may require libpcap headers (libpcap-dev)
# and/or build tools. Keep them in requirements so pip can install them when the
# system packages are present.
